x=1 was initially created as a student project to learn android
development and gradually became the app you can play today:

The x=1 project is tailored to be developed by one developer.

This especially shows in its architecture. You will see a one
activity per screen, one module approach with the minimal
usage of libraries. All chosen to reduce complexity.

Additionally, you will see a special emphasis on testing.

Over 3000 unit-tests and over 100 ui-tests reduce the
risk of regressions and thus allowed me to easily add
new features or to conduct refactorings to my liking.

I don't want to withhold though, that I just enjoy
identifying requirements and converting them into
automatically executed tests.

The project was actively developed until early 2021
and lastly tested with Android Studio 4.2.1,
Gradle 6.7.1 and Kotlin 1.5.0.

Since the app is available in production, all sensitive
identifiers are 'redacted'. This makes the multi player
and donation parts unusable. If you want to experience
them, best install the app from the google play store.
